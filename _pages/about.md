### Research & Education Background
As Assistant Professor at [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en), I conduct research and teach in **intelligent/automated manufacturing technologies and systems engineering**. Previously researched functional materials, vibration control, systems engineering, manufacturing process analysis, and semiconductor processes at:
- [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca)
- [Shibaura Institute of Technology (SIT)](https://www.shibaura-it.ac.jp/en/) 
- [Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech, currently Institute of Science Tokyo)](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english)

Earned Ph.D. in Mechanical Control Systems Engineering from Tokyo Tech (2015). Hold a Japanese government-registered Professional Engineer (Mechanical Engineering) license and a Master's degree(Bio-Application and Systems Engineering) from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, B.Eng(Mechanical Systems Engineering) from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. Associate degree (Mechanical Engineering) from Tokyo Metropolitan College of Technology (a 5-year specialized college after graduating from junior high school).
