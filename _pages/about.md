I am an Assistant Professor at [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en), specializing in intelligent manufacturing and systems engineering. With my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Control Systems Engineering from [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) (2015) and Professional Engineer license (Japan), I bridge academic research and industrial applications.

### Research Focus
**Smart Manufacturing Systems** integrating:
- **Functional Materials**: 4D printing of self-organizing structures, sensor-embedded actuators
- **AI-Driven Tribology**: Deep learning for real-time friction/vibration control in bearing systems
- **Next-Gen Production**: Digital twin-assisted process optimization for composite manufacturing

### Key Achievements
- Awards: JSME Young Engineer Award, MAZAK Foundation Prize, TokyoTech Suematsu Award
- Patents: 3 granted in production technologies and vibration control
- Competitive Grants: JSPS KAKENHI (¥5M), AMADA Foundation (¥2.8M), NSK Foundation (¥3.5M)

### Industry Collaboration
Developed solutions for:
- **Machine Tool Manufacturer**: Metamaterial design via metal 3D printing
- **Bearing R&D Center**: Vibration suppression in precision systems
- **Food Processing SMEs**: Mold-free production technologies
- **Composite Material Producer**: Glass fiber 3D printing optimization

### Academic Activities
- Courses taught:  
  `Sensors, Instrumentation & Industrial Applications` (Undergraduate)  
  `System Thinking and Modeling` (Graduate)
- International research team management (China, Thailand, Canada, Egypt, Japan)
- Supervised multiple Best Paper Award winners at IEEE/JSME conferences

### Let's Collaborate
Seeking partners for:
- Smart manufacturing systems development
- Functional materials applications
- International research programs (Horizon Europe, etc.)
- Student exchange and joint supervision
