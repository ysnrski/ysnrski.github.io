I am an Assistant Professor at [Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en), specializing in intelligent manufacturing and systems engineering. I have previously held academic positions at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/), [Shibaura Institute of Technology (SIT)](https://www.shibaura-it.ac.jp/en/index.html), and [Tokyo Institute of Technology (TokyoTech, Institute of Science Tokyo)](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english), where I contributed to both research and teaching in areas such as functional materials, vibration control, systems engineering and manufacturing process analysis.

I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Control Systems Engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2015. I am also [a licensed Professional Engineer (P.E.) in Japan](https://www.engineer.or.jp/sub09/), and I hold a Master’s degree in Bio-Application and Systems Engineering and a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical System Engineering from [Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology](https://www.tuat.ac.jp/en/).

My current research focuses on the application of functional materials, tribology, and systems engineering in advanced manufacturing. I aim to push the boundaries of traditional manufacturing methods by integrating smart materials, sensors/actuators, and AI/ML technologies into functional products.

Feel free to explore my research and projects here, and learn more about my work and potential collaborations.
