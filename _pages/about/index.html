I have previously held academic positions at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Shibaura Institute of Technology (SIT), and Tokyo Institute of Technology (TokyoTech, Institute of Science Tokyo), where I contributed to both research and teaching in areas such as functional materials, vibration control, systems engineering and manufacturing process analysis.</p> <p>I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Control Systems Engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2015. I am also a licensed Professional Engineer (P.E.) in Japan, and I hold a Master’s degree in Bio-Application and Systems Engineering and a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical System Engineering from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology.</p> <p>My current research focuses on the application of functional materials, tribology, and systems engineering in advanced manufacturing. I aim to push the boundaries of traditional manufacturing methods by integrating smart materials, sensors/actuators, and AI/ML technologies into functional products.</p> <p>Feel free to explore my research and projects here, and learn more about my work and potential collaborations.</p> </body></html>
