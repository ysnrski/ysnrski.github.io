I received a question about this topic on social media, so I've summarized it in this post. Although my experience working at Japanese educational institutions was a few years ago, and preparation methods vary by university, this post will be a helpful starting point for every student.

## Introduction

Japan offers opportunities for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education through its diverse higher education institutions. Understanding the structure of Japan's educational system, the types of universities available, and unique institutions like “Kosen” (a Five-year college system enrolling after graduating from junior high school) is crucial for international students considering studying in Japan. This post provides an overview of Japan's STEM education system and key insights based on my experiences.

## Types of Higher Education Institutions in Japan

### 1. National Universities

- Funded and operated by the Japanese government.
- Lower tuition fees compared to private universities.
- Various scholarship opportunities for international students.
- Examples: [University of Tokyo, Kyoto University](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/prospective-students/prospective_students.html), [Tohoku University,](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/admissions/index.html) [Tokyo Institute of Technology (Institute of Science Tokyo)](https://admissions.isct.ac.jp/en).

### 2. Public (Prefectural and Municipal) Universities

- Funded by local governments (Eg, Osaka prefecture, Yokohama City).

- Examples: [Osaka Prefecture University](https://www.osakafu-u.ac.jp/en/admission/), [Yokohama City University](https://www-user.yokohama-cu.ac.jp/~english/index.php/admissions/).

### 3. Private Universities

- Privately funded and managed.
- Vary in reputation, facilities, and research capabilities.
- Higher tuition fees, but modern facilities.
- Examples: [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/admissions/), [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/admission/en/), [Tokyo University of Science](https://www.notion.so/Personal-home-17a3c1b6baa580af8e2feb35e17a54ef?pvs=21), [Shibaura Institute of Technology](https://www.shibaura-it.ac.jp/en/study/index.html).

### 4. **Kosen**

- [Unique five-year programs](https://www.notion.so/Personal-home-17a3c1b6baa580af8e2feb35e17a54ef?pvs=21) integrating secondary and tertiary education, specializing in engineering and applied sciences.
- Graduates can enter the workforce or transfer to a university.
- Known for producing highly skilled engineers with practical experience.
- Offer an **Associate Degree**, though recognition may vary globally.

## Features of Japan's STEM Education System

### Strong Emphasis on Fundamental Sciences

- Japanese STEM programs focus heavily on mathematics and foundational sciences before specialization.
- Students develop strong theoretical knowledge before research or practical application.

### A research thesis is mandatory for graduation

- 4th-grade undergrad, Master's, and Ph.D. students engage in rigorous research projects by belonging to specific laboratories.
- Most students must write a research thesis and conduct an oral defence presentation.

### Industry Collaboration and Practical Training

- Many universities have strong industry ties, providing internships and employment opportunities.
- Engineering and technology students often work on industry-sponsored/government-sponsored projects.

## Choosing a University in Japan

### 1. Choosing a University for Undergraduate Studies

**Key Factors:**

- **Program Availability:** Check if the university offers English-taught STEM programs (e.g., Shibaura Institute of Technology offers a program from which students can graduate using only English).
- **Research and Facilities:** National universities generally have better research facilities, while private universities offer modern campuses and strong industry links.
- **Tuition & Scholarships:** National and public universities charge lower tuition fees, and scholarships like [MEXT](https://www.studyinjapan.go.jp/en/planning/scholarships/mext-scholarships/) and [JASSO](https://www.jasso.go.jp/en/ryugaku/scholarship_j/index.html) are available.

**Career Paths:**

- **Entering the workforce:** Opportunities in automotive, electronics, and robotics industries.
- **Continuing to a master's program:** Many engineering graduates pursue a master's degree from national universities to increase job opportunities and salary potential.

### 2. Choosing a University for Graduate Studies

**Key Factors:**

- **Supervisor and Research Lab:** Choosing a graduate school in Japan is about finding the right professor and lab.
- **Research vs. Coursework:** Most STEM programs are research-oriented but include coursework.
- **Scholarships & Funding:** MEXT, university scholarships, and industry partnerships provide financial support. Most universities provide scholarship databases for students (Example: [Tokyo Tech](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/students/tuition/scholarships))

**Career Paths:**

- Joining high-tech industries (R&D engineer, AI specialist, materials scientist, etc.).
- Continuing to a Ph.D. for advanced research opportunities.

### 3. Choosing a University for Doctoral Studies

**Key Factors:**

- **Research Reputation:** Japan excels in robotics, materials science, and renewable energy. Top universities include the University of Tokyo, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Kyoto University, and Tohoku University.
- **Funding Opportunities:** Ph.D. students can receive research assistant (RA) positions, MEXT funding, industry-sponsored support, or a [JSPE research fellowship(DC1/DC2)](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/index.html).
- **Career Paths:**
    - Becoming a university professor or researcher.
    - Working in R&D for global companies.
    - Joining government research institutions (e.g., [AIST](https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_e/humanres/), [RIKEN](https://www.riken.jp/en/careers/openings/)).

## Preparing for University Admission in Japan

### 1. Undergraduate Admission

- Check university websites for application requirements.
- Many universities have special entrance exams for international students.

### 2. Graduate Admission

- Contact potential professors in advance (Email is always the best way to make the first contact).
- Professors or principal investigators (PIs) run research labs; obtaining their support is crucial for admission.
- Apply for scholarships early, as funding applications often start a year before enrollment.
- Some PIs allow students to join as “**research students” in their laboratory** before official admission.

### 3. Finding the Right Research Lab

**Useful Databases:**

- [**Researchmap](https://researchmap.jp/?lang=en):** Japan's largest researcher database.
- [**Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/):** Helps track professors' research and publications.

**Understanding Lab Structures in Japan:**

- **Professor-led labs:** One professor supervises all students in his laboratory.
- **Collaborative labs:** Multiple faculty members manage one laboratory.
- **Roll of Assistant Professors:** This role has two meanings in Japan. Although some assistant professors (tenure-track principal investigators) run their labs, most belong to specific labs and assist full/associate professors (their roles seem like postdocs).
    - Since I was a tenure-track assistant professor as a PI, I ran my own lab. Most tenure-track assistant professors have the same responsibility as full/associate professors for various duties in the university.

## Straight Talk

The above are general concepts. Recently, the landscape of higher education in Japan has changed significantly. Here are my comments for applicants:

- **The Importance of Supervision Student Numbers**
    
    The number of students a professor supervises is a crucial factor. In private universities, it is common for one professor to manage 30-40 students in a lab. In national universities, however, the typical number of students per professor is 5-10, allowing for more in-depth supervision and affordable badges for your degree research.
    
- **Career Path After Earning a Ph.D.**
    
    Being cautious about career prospects after earning a Ph.D. is essential if you are willing to stay in Japan as a worker. In Japan, having a Ph.D. may narrow your career options (this might also be true in other countries). Therefore, many Japanese students choose to work in industry after earning a master's degree. However, for international students, earning a Ph.D. can expand career opportunities. There are also programs where you can earn a Ph.D. while working in a company, known as "part-time Ph.D. programs for workers."
    

## Conclusion

Japan offers STEM education opportunities, but choosing the right institution requires careful planning. National and public universities are affordable and strong in research, while private universities offer modern infrastructure and industry connections. Kosen institutions are a unique pathway for hands-on technical education. Understanding the admission process and securing funding are key to a successful academic journey in Japan.
